1. Implement JavaScript objects to store room/person information.
    -Perhaps make the JS object a 2D array of max dimensions? Each element would represent a possible room.

2. Rename attributes/function names to follow python standards.

3. Store location inside person instead of room.
    -This will make frontend much more straightforward.
    -Give each person and room a unique identifier. Use that to create JSON.
    -JSON should be house < rooms/actors.

4. Reorganize files so navigation is easier.
    -Simulations go into single directory.
    -HTML/CSS/JS go into single directory.
