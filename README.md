House simulation.

This project allows to create house simulations.

Possible improvements:
1. Add functionality for houses with multiple floors.
2. Add input validation that all rooms in a house are connected.

Possible refactoring:
1. Implement JavaScript objects to store room/person information.
2. Rename attributes/function names to follow python standards.
3. Store location inside person instead of room.

Usage.
Run simulation file itself like
`python myHouseSim.py` or
`python jonsHouseSim.py`

Or run `python simulate.py <project_name>` for example `python simulate.py myHouseSim`
